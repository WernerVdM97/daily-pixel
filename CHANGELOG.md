# Changelog

All notable changes to The Warden's Oak are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.1.6] — 2026-06-15

### Changed
- **Outcome rendering now shows all changes**: items gained/lost, location changes, health/wealth/stamina deltas derived directly from mutations (no longer relies on buggy caller-provided flags)
- **v3 system prompt**: mandatory mutations on resolution, concrete mutation recipes per scenario (combat→damage, travel→set_location, failure→cost, success→cost+reward)
- Player inventory passed to LLM context so it can make informed remove_item/add_item decisions
- Available location names passed to LLM context — location names must match seeded DB locations exactly

### Fixed
- Mutations validation no longer crashes on malformed entries — invalid mutations are filtered, valid ones applied, errors logged (per spec)
- Idle messages now show during all three loading states (previously only day-job quick action showed them)
- `add_item` mutations from LLM with `stat: null` no longer crash — prompt now explicitly requires stat value, and engine drops malformed entries
- Location scenes now resolve properly — LLM knows the exact names of all 9 seeded locations
- `set_location` to an unknown location is now rejected by the engine (matched case-insensitively against known locations, then snapped to the canonical casing) — prevents the player being moved to a phantom location with no scene
- Removed per-action debug logging from the resolution path

## [0.1.5] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- Item set selection step (step 7) in `/join` wizard, filtered by chosen class
- Starting items auto-assigned from `item-sets.yml` on character creation
- `VERSION` file and startup log line (`[version] 0.1.5` in yellow)
- `scripts/clear-admin.sh` for clearing a user's character from the DB

### Changed
- `/look` is now ephemeral (player-only visibility)

### Fixed
- Prevent spawning parallel `/action` instances for the same character (in-memory mutex + DB guard)
- Custom modal submit now deletes the stale day-job menu message so only the action scene shows
- Button clicks in `/join` wizard immediately grey out via `deferUpdate` — no more double-click lag

## [0.1.4] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- Bail button always shown via `ensureBail` fallback ("Step back" if LLM omits it)
- `Custom…` button on day-job menu opens modal for free-text action input
- Final action outcome posted as public follow-up to the channel

### Changed
- Day-job buttons blank immediately on click, show "Starting…" then decision
- Block new actions when out of rolls with a friendly message instead of empty menu

### Fixed
- Day-job buttons use `deferUpdate` — greys out all buttons, prevents double-clicks
- LLM outcome text shown as prompt when `done:true` returned with no options
- Roll economy enforced at `/action` entry point

## [0.1.3] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- ASCII scene rendering in `/hi` (oak), `/look`, and `/action` (current location)
- Day-job quick action buttons when `/action` called with no description
- Action trail shown during decisions (original input, previous choices, current prompt)
- Action trail shown in final outcome (each decision + DC, then roll result)

### Changed
- `/action` is now ephemeral — prevents cross-user button conflicts
- LLM reasoning content logged as `[llm:thoughts]` when verbose

### Fixed
- Non-array mutations from LLM guarded against and validated
- Variable ordering in decision cap logic fixed

## [0.1.2] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- Loading state with greyed buttons during LLM processing
- All commands classified as ephemeral or public (`stats`, `backpack`, `journal`, `bug`, `feedback`, `help`, `hi`, `join` are player-only)
- Color-coded log tags with ANSI

### Changed
- Decision cap reduced from 3 to 2
- Switched from `message.edit` to Discord built-in spinner + `editReply` for button updates
- Static imports for `join`/`action` handlers — removes latency on every button click

### Fixed
- LLM response validation: warn on missing label, wrong stat, bad `dc_modifier`
- Action button clicks resolve via stored pending decisions (option label, not index)
- DeepSeek thinking mode enabled, 15s fetch timeout added
- LLM fallback errors logged; divine intervention handled in `startAction`

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- Probabilistic `/action` flow: LLM-driven decisions, roll mechanics, outcome resolution
- Action state machine with per-character mid-action persistence and resume
- Mutations system: health, stamina, wealth, location, items, NPCs
- `VERBOSE` and `VERBOSE_LLM` env vars for debugging

### Fixed
- `/action` description is optional — blank resumes mid-action, missing + no mid-action shows usage

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- Project scaffold: TypeScript, `better-sqlite3`, Discord.js, DeepSeek LLM gateway
- 9-table SQLite schema with idempotent migrations
- 6-step `/join` character creation wizard
- Deterministic commands: `/hi`, `/look`, `/backpack`, `/stats`, `/journal`, `/help`, `/feedback`, `/bug`, `/ping`
- YAML asset loading with fail-fast validation (`classes.yml`, `backgrounds.yml`, `races.yml`, `alignments.yml`, `day-jobs.yml`)
- World tick: `/sleep` admin command, NPC movement, world scaling
- CI/CD: Containerfile, systemd service, LXC provisioning
