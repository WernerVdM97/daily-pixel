## scratchpad (humans start here)

### TBD — POC polish (small UI wins, no spark warranted)
- [ ] some jobs must be performable in unsafe areas.
- [ ] on the join screen. lets improve the formatting around the inline skills displayed next to class, race and upbringing. perhaps use more line feeds and bold.
   - also show the emojis of the chosen class, upbringing, and race in the selected crossed out list
- [ ] establish POC polish scope game doc
- [ ] hints on action message
  - one action remaining, low stamina, unsafe location
- [ ] derived/distilled action should show as an emoji next to the decision head while the action evolves — today the decision title is hardcoded `🤔 Decision` (`action.ts:552`) and the distilled-type emoji only appears on the outcome breadcrumb (`buildOutcomeEmbed`).
- [ ] custom (free-text) actions need a real "thinking" screen — three dots + "thinking…" as its own page. Preset day-job actions already show a ⏳ "Starting…" loading envelope (`action.ts:204`); the custom-modal path shows nothing before `engine.startAction`.
- [ ] `/stats` — show how the character builder (race/class) shaped each base score, and make it prettier. The base+gear breakdown already ships (`+6 (+4 base, +2 🎒)`); levels/upskilling/traits and per-race/class char-creator guidance are deferred → MVP below.
- [ ] global broadcast on a natural 1 or 20 — a short public shout-out when anyone crits or fumbles. (Wider community feedback — tagging, showing off — is deferred → MVP below.)

### Player requests — prod data review (2026-07-03)

Open *feature* asks mined from the `feedback`/`bug_reports` tables (snapshot `warden-20260703-133521`). Bug-shaped reports already fixed in `[Unreleased]`/0.2.5–0.2.6 are omitted; these are the requests still open. `F#`/`B#` cite the feedback/bug row. The four POC-sized Discord/comms wins are lumped into the **[[polish-v0.2.8]]** spark; the rest route to MVP/sparks.

- [>] **Show who owns each character on action outcomes** (F#3, F#8) → [[polish-v0.2.8]].
- [>] **Distinct emoji for release notes vs weekly recap in pins** (F#20) → [[polish-v0.2.8]].
- [>] **Trim pinned-message noise** (F#18) → [[polish-v0.2.8]].
- [>] **Weekly-recap thread UX rework** (F#19) → [[polish-v0.2.8]].
- [ ] **Player-founded structures become real locations** — a player who *starts building* a temple expects it to exist as its own explorable/buildable place, not resolve to an existing or adjacent location (F#4, B#8 — Ulrich's temple). Relates to lazy world growth + world-state tracking [[mvp-data-model]].
- [ ] **Cross-player buff actions** — praying/blessing "for everyone" should actually apply a buff mutation to the other players present, not no-op (B#11). Needs a multiplayer-aware mutation; see [[multiplayer]].
- [ ] **Items should be usable, not stat-bonus clutter** — players accumulate notes/keys/etc. that only grant a passive stat bonus and never get *used*; make items actually do something (F#11). Tracked in [[improved-item-features]] but not previously on this list.
- [ ] **Communal / offering currency separate from personal gold** — a player wanted to spend offering-basket funds (not their own coin) on temple supplies; distinguish a shared/temple purse from personal wealth (F#9). Nuance under the MVP "make wealth spendable/meaningful" item below.
- [ ] **Rework divine intervention** (F#21) — it's a system-failure fallback, so it must not read or be stored as an action row, must not cost anything, and must refund the roll (or at least the first per day). And it must be clearly signalled to the player as a system failure/fallback, not dressed up as an in-world outcome.

## MVP — deferred

- [ ] dnd statblock scraper
- [ ] menu framework coupled to views — standardise the views/command/message terminology and a tab/subtab layout per message. See [[discord-interaction-layer]] (the interaction-plumbing layer; subtabs are explicitly MVP there).
- [ ] make wealth (and stamina, health) spendable/meaningful, and define death / 0 HP. The death track is deferred from the POC by design ([[the-poc]]); see [[mvp-progression]] (lifecycle/death), [[mvp-combat]] (HP stakes), [[mvp+npc-economy]] (wealth sink).
- [ ] cap rolls per action type + add a short-rest option; reward slow build-up / daily-work play on subsequent actions instead of jumping straight in. Check for hard-coded roll caps. Extends [[roll-economy-timeouts-and-world-growth]].
- [ ] character progression depth — levels, upskilling, traits; the char creator shows which stats matter per race/class and how each modifies them. See [[mvp-progression]], [[mvp-character-drivers]].
- [ ] richer community feedback in chat — tag people (not too spammy), let players show off to each other. See [[mvp-social-model]], [[mvp-discord-ux]].
- [ ] use both models differently, flash for generating quick responses and daily work, pro for decision trees.
- [ ] **LLM latency** *(deferred from [[polish-v0.2.8]], 2026-07-04)* — the 2026-07-04 snapshot shows mean ~12.8s, 94 calls >20s, 26 >30s (max 47.5s); this is what surfaces to players as `timed_out`/`bailed` outcomes. Rein in reasoning length and tighten the timeout+fallback. Overlaps the model-split above and the thinking-on/off experiments in [[mvp-llm-prompt-architecture]].
- [ ] **Auto-resolve roll refund** *(deferred from [[polish-v0.2.8]], 2026-07-04)* — bug reports say a `done` auto-resolve can consume a roll while doing nothing / not refund it (B#1, B#10). The no-op/timeout/bail refund graces already exist and this list concluded there's no deterministic double-decrement in `startAction`, so the job is to verify the `done` path specifically hands the roll back on a true no-op. Part of the broader auto-resolve wound owned by the prompt refactor.
- [ ] saturday special event, spawn an "evil npc" somewhere with a hint. Incentivise hunting it/them and add npc death mutation
- [ ] choose age
- [ ] Improved journal/story
  - track or show quests or hints?
  - add clue system? also grants +1 roll
- [>] travelling to existing or already explored areas should be deterministic based on the distance and/or difficulty. → now designed in [[per-player-map-exploration]] (engine-owned routing + `stamina = Σ edge difficulty`; `distance` reserved for the time mechanic).
- [ ] **`CharacterRepository.update` allow-list omits `max_stamina`** — the column exists and is settable, but `update`'s field allow-list leaves it out, so `max_stamina` can't be persisted through the repo (the sim harness routes around it with raw SQL in `src/sim/driver.ts`). Add it to the allow-list (and audit the list against the schema for other gaps) so callers don't have to bypass the repo.
- [ ] **schema: normalise location references to FK ids** — locations are keyed by `name` (TEXT) everywhere (`player_characters.location`, `npcs.location`, `location_edges`, `actions.location_name`). `actions.location_name` is a deliberate point-in-time *snapshot* (keep it), but a future polish pass should decide whether the live-reference tables move to `location_id` FKs consistently — a holistic refactor, not a lone divergence. See [[per-player-map-exploration]] §6.
- [ ] use reactions as a way of buffering input before a button is pressed (expend items or use certain abilities to amplify actions, also works for trades) 
  `this is cool!!!`
  (but does it work with ephemeral..?)
- [ ] stealth or following mechanics?
- [ ] mechanic — bonus rolls: an LLM `modify_rolls_remaining: +N` reward is a deliberate mechanic, not a bug (the "extra throw" report traces to this; no deterministic double-decrement exists — a roll is spent exactly once per action in startAction). Design it properly: when/why the world grants an extra roll, and surface it to the player so it reads as a reward. Belongs to the roll-economy work in [[mvp-llm-prompt-architecture]].
- [>] `[[mvp-llm-prompt-architecture]]` — prompt refactor:
  - optimise prompt to llm as markdown (more friendly) not json. Response can remain json
  - options should still be produced by the llm, but there should be some rolls before to influence it
    example: player prompts they want to hunt. llm responds with choices, player succeeds, bot then rolls for rarity of an item, llm generates item.
    example: player trains at camp, llm provides choices, player fails, bot rolls for the severity (loses a lot of stamina), llm gives outcome message.
    THIS IDEA NEEDS A LOT OF REFINEMENT or just better system prompts.
  - outcomes should be rolled before the response flavour is generated.
    roll as DM and add certain promp elements. determine outcome sentiment before prompting.
  - utilise multiple agent in short bursts for actions or chain agents instead of one big chat?
  - try disabling thinking again? Or use A B testing with thinking on and off
  - optimise prompts with simulations to see when LLM digresses
  - use testing data as a couple of LLM mocks (for dev'ing or unit testing)
- [>] `[[mvp-combat]]` — there is no combat, this should be a core mechanic..!
- [>] `[[mvp-data-model]]` — graph db for backend coherency (relationships, items, distances, groups)
  - better world state tracking, which areas are hostile, how hostile, what type of faction or encounters to expect
- [>] `[[mvp+npc-economy]]` — introduce NPCs more often in interactions and save them (also reuse them more often)
- [>] `[[mvp+world-state-projection]]` — rethink sleep mechanic, yes we want people to sleep at the wardens oak, but they shouldnt be able to just tp out of an unsafe or far away location.
  - related to world state tracking too: finishing your day in an unsafe location should have conesquences
    (you dont sleep well or you get put in jail and must escape)
- [>] `[[mvp-ascii-render-pipeline]]` — scrape prettier ascii art or images for converting with ascii image converter

## Triaged out of TBD (for provenance — 2026-06-26)

- **Done / shipped (struck):** preset work labelled `Work:` not `🧭 Quest:` and commute `−1 stamina` shown on the thinking page; the no-op refund scope question (stamina-/roll-only "shrug" is again a refundable no-op — D1 follow-up). All in `[Unreleased]`.
- **Working as designed (struck):** post-`/join` welcome shows no "Hi" button because that screen *is* the Hi screen (`getNavButtons` filters the current command — `format.ts:137`).
- **Routed to sparks:** Warden NPC duplicates (hooded figure vs The Warden) → [[mutation-vocabulary-refinement]] §2 (NPC name-resolution); world evolves with time / rising DC / new threats → [[prompt-separation-of-concerns]] Thread B (World Tier); global rumours pulling players toward dangerous unexplored locations → [[prompt-separation-of-concerns]] Thread B + [[per-player-map-exploration]] (`reveal_location` leaf); end-to-end flow tests with mocked LLM + scripted button presses → [[mvp-llm-prompt-architecture]].
